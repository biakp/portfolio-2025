# Adding Splendore Theme Image

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Image Successfully Added ‚úÖ
Your Splendore theme image has been added and is now displaying on the project page!

- **File Name**: `tray-ecommerce-theme.png` 
- **Theme Name**: Splendore
- **Status**: Active and displaying

### Step 2: Add Image to Project
1. Save your image to: `public/projects/tray-ecommerce-theme.jpg`
2. The full path should be: `c:\Users\beatr\OneDrive\√Årea de Trabalho\portfo\public\projects\tray-ecommerce-theme.jpg`

### Step 3: That's It!
The project page is already configured to display your image automatically once you add it to the correct location.

## Image Guidelines

### Best Practices
- **High Quality**: Use crisp, clear screenshots
- **Responsive Design**: Show both desktop and mobile views if possible
- **Professional**: Clean, polished appearance
- **Representative**: Should showcase the actual theme you built

### Image Content Suggestions
- Homepage of the e-commerce store
- Product listing page
- Product detail page
- Shopping cart or checkout process
- Mobile responsive design
- Any custom features you implemented

### Technical Details
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (matches the container)
- **Optimization**: The OptimizedImage component will handle automatic optimization
- **Loading**: Image uses priority loading for better performance
- **Accessibility**: Alt text is already configured for screen readers

## Alternative Image Names
If you prefer a different filename, update this line in the project page:
```typescript
src="/projects/your-image-name.jpg"
```

## Multiple Images (Optional Enhancement)
If you want to add an image gallery, let me know and I can help implement a carousel or grid layout to showcase multiple screenshots of your Tray theme.

## Fallback Design
If no image is provided, the page will show a elegant placeholder with the Tray branding and description, so the page looks professional either way.

## File Location Reminder
üìÅ Place your image here: `public/projects/tray-ecommerce-theme.jpg`

The image will automatically appear on your project page at `/projects/tray-ecommerce` once you add it!
